# Array Manipulation

## Description

This project implements an efficient solution to the Array Manipulation problem using the difference array technique. The function supports multiple range update operations on an array and determines the maximum value after all updates. 

## Features

- Handles multiple range increment operations.
- Uses a difference array approach for optimal performance.
- Includes test cases to validate functionality and performance.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ricardoguerrasantana/array-manipulation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd array-manipulation
   ```

3. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

You can use the `arrayManipulation` function by importing it into your script:

```javascript
const arrayManipulation = require('./array-manipulation.js');
```

### Example

```javascript
let n = 5;
let queries = [
  [1, 2, 100],
  [2, 5, 100],
  [3, 4, 100],
];
let result = arrayManipulation(n, queries);
console.log(result); // Output: 200
```

## Implementation Details

The optimization in the array manipulation implementation is primarily achieved through the use of the difference array technique. This method allows us to efficiently handle multiple range update operations without having to iterate through the entire range for each update, which would be computationally expensive. 

### Difference Array Technique

The key optimization in this solution is the use of the **difference array technique**. This method allows us to handle multiple range update operations efficiently by only recording changes at the boundaries of the range instead of updating every element within the range.

- For each query `[a, b, k]`, instead of incrementing all elements between indices `a` and `b` by `k`, we:
  - Add `k` at index `a-1` to mark the start of the increment.
  - Subtract `k` at index `b` (if `b < n`) to mark the end of the increment.

### Efficient Calculation of Final Array Values

Once all queries have been processed, we compute the actual values in the array by iterating through it and maintaining a cumulative sum based on the differences stored. This allows us to determine the value at any index in constant time as we traverse the array.

### Time Complexity

The use of the difference array allows for significant optimization:
- **Processing Queries**: Each query is processed in $O(1)$ time, leading to an overall time complexity of $O(q)$, where $q$ is the number of queries.
- **Final Array Calculation**: After processing all queries, the actual values in the array are calculated in $O(n)$, where $n$ is the size of the array.

Thus, the total time complexity of the algorithm is $O(n + q)$, which is highly efficient compared to a direct approach that would require $O(n \times q)$ time.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity of the algorithm is $O(n)$ due to the additional array used for storing the differences.
